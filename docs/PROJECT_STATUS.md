# Project Status & Decision Log

_Last updated: 2026-07-06 (session 70: UX redesign **Phase 4 is COMPLETE ✅**. Session C shipped the
last two tasks: **4.5** the Aufbau/Festigen/Gemischt progression chip (`src/lib/phase.ts`, a pure
derived label on the existing theme-mastery ratio, no new state) on the Fortschritt theme grid and the
city-building tap label, and **4.6** this gates/docs wrap. Sessions A (4.1–4.2, typed recall) and B
(4.3–4.4, Lesen/Hören authentic input) shipped in sessions 68–69; full detail for all of Phase 4 is in
the "Resume here" handoffs below and the archive. Session 62's game plan,
`docs/plans/GAME_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, remains PROPOSED and is now the standing next-step candidate
now that redesign Phases 1–4 are all shipped. The working branch is reassigned every session, so
**`main` is always the source of truth**. Product name: **Genauly** (domain `genauly.de`)._

This file is the **lean, living** status doc: current state plus the two most recent session handoffs.
Start at the `## Resume here (next session)` section near the end. Companion files:
- **`docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md`** — stable reference that rarely changes: the founder backlog,
  the product-evaluation findings, per-session model guidance, and reusable research findings.
- **`docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`** — the append-only history: older session handoffs
  (sessions 2–67) and accumulated deploy/ops notes.
- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — the "why" behind locked decisions. Full design: `docs/archive/EXPANSION_PLAN.md`.

**Doc-hygiene rule (keep this file lean):** when you append a new handoff to `## Resume here`, move any
handoff older than the two most recent into `docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`. Keep this file
under ~250 lines. This split was done in session 70 (the file had grown to 1,624 lines / 140 kB).

## Who I'm working with
- **Founder is non-technical.** Operate as a seasoned CTO: be decisive and opinionated, minimize
  the founder's operational burden, protect them from surprise costs, and aim for an award-worthy,
  genuinely useful product — not just feature parity.

## Where things stand

### Original SPA — live (on `main`)
- Full client-side SPA: onboarding, dashboard, vocabulary (flashcards/quiz/list), redemittel
  (browse + practice), branching simulations, timed exam mode, analytics, settings.
- Engines: SRS (`engine/srs.ts`; SM-2 originally, swapped to FSRS-6 in s53 / PR #275), XP/levels/tiers
  (`engine/scoring.ts`), Web Speech TTS/STT (`engine/speech.ts`), branching dialogue runner
  (`engine/dialogue.ts`).
- State: zustand stores persisted to localStorage (`b2beruf.progress.v1`, `b2beruf.settings.v1`).

### Phase 1 — SHIPPED & LIVE ✅ (on `main` via `pages.yml`, founder-verified 2026-05-30)
- **Types (1A):** `GrammarTopic`/`GrammarDrill`/`GrammarGroup`, `Collocation`, leveled
  `QuizQuestion` union (`MCQQuestion`/`WordOrderQuestion`/`MatchingQuestion`), `PracticeArea`
  + `WeaknessCategory` — all in `src/types/index.ts`.
- **Engine (1B):** `src/engine/quiz.ts` `buildThemeQuiz(themeId, difficulty, count)` generates
  mixed sets from vocab/collocations/grammar banks; reuses SRS (`reviewVocab`) + scoring.
  Added `XP.quizEasy/quizMedium/quizHard/grammarDrill`.
- **Content (1C):** `src/data/collocations.ts` (**396** Nomen-Verb pairs, ~36/theme);
  `src/data/grammar.ts` rewritten to **11 `GrammarTopic`s** w/ drills (Konnektoren, Relativsätze,
  da-/wo-Wörter, Verbstellung/TeKaMoLo, Nebensätze, Kasus, Nomen-Verb, K-II, Modal, Passiv);
  `redemittel.ts` grown to **72**; **10 connectors** added to vocab (**304** words);
  `src/data/practiceAreas.ts` weakness→deep-link registry.
- **UI (1D):** `/grammar` (`features/grammar/GrammarHub` + `GrammarDrillCard`) and `/quiz`
  (`features/quiz/QuizHub` + `QuizRunner`), both query-param driven (`?topic=`, `?theme=&level=`).
  Wired into Sidebar, router (guarded), and Dashboard daily-module tiles.
- **Verified live:** Grammar topics + drills and the leveled theme quizzes work on the deployed
  Pages site; `npm run build` green; no duplicate ids.

### Branding — DONE (live)
- App named **Genauly**, tagline **"German for real life"** (header, sidebar, onboarding,
  `<title>`/meta, `package.json` description, PWA manifest). Custom domain **genauly.de** (CNAME shipped).
  Tagline was updated from the old "German that clicks" across all six surfaces in session 22 (PR #145).
- **Default logo (locked 2026-06-08):** the **rounded gradient "G" with transparent corners**.
  The canonical file is **`public/genauly-default-logo-transparent-corners.png`** and it is the
  default logo in every in-app spot (sign-in dialog, mobile header, desktop sidebar, landing,
  onboarding, `/privacy`). Favicon uses PNG files (`public/favicon-32.png`, `public/favicon-16.png`)
  generated from the real logo (replacing the old `favicon.svg` which rendered a plain system-font "G").
  `public/pwa-*.png` and `apple-touch-icon.png` are **full-bleed opaque** (no transparent corners)
  so iOS home-screen icons don't show dark corners on the OS rounding mask.
  - **Do NOT make the in-app logo full-bleed.** A full-bleed square variant exists **only** for
    Google's OAuth consent screen (its circular crop shows white through transparent corners). It
    is not committed to the repo and must not replace the app logo. (Full-bleed-everywhere was
    shipped then reverted in PRs #120/#121 — keep the app on the rounded transparent logo.)

### Phase 2 — SHIPPED & LIVE ✅ (squash-merged to `main` 2026-05-31, founder-verified)
- Supabase auth + cloud sync + AI writing eval fully deployed and smoke-tested by founder.
- **Supabase project:** `stkfdavpjflpqoxjunnj`. Publishable key committed in
  `src/lib/supabaseConfig.ts` (safe — all tables owner-only RLS). Service-role key and Anthropic
  key live only in Supabase Edge Function secrets (never in the repo or browser).
- **2A schema:** applied via Supabase dashboard SQL editor — `profiles`, `progress`,
  `writing_evaluations`, `ai_usage`, owner-only RLS, auto-provision trigger on auth.users,
  `bump_ai_usage` atomic RPC. `profiles.tier` flag present (monetization-ready).
- **2B auth + sync:** `useAuthStore` (guest anon sign-in + email magic-link); `cloudSync.ts`
  (offline-first: localStorage stays cache, pull+MERGE on login, debounced write-through).
  `AccountPanel` shown in Settings. **Guest sign-in works and is the primary path.**
  Email sign-in works when clicked through but has rate-limit issues on Supabase's free SMTP
  (fix: add Resend SMTP in Auth settings — deferred).
- **2C writing UI:** `/writing` route live; short/long tasks per theme; one insight card + "Üben"
  deep-link via `practiceAreas` registry. Added to Sidebar + Dashboard daily modules.
- **2D edge function:** `evaluate-writing` deployed via Supabase dashboard code editor (NOT CLI —
  sandbox network blocks `api.supabase.com`). Daily limit (5/day) + monthly auto-shutoff ($5 cap)
  + input-hash cache + LanguageTool pre-check (templated spelling path = no LLM cost) + one Haiku
  call fallback chain. **Verified working end-to-end** — founder test returned correct spelling
  insight with "Rechtschreibung üben" deep-link.
- **Known deployment quirk:** the Supabase dashboard pre-fills a "Hello [name]!" boilerplate when
  creating a function. Must select-all-delete before pasting the real code. Caught and fixed.
- **Anthropic key:** ✅ rotated by the founder (the original, once pasted in chat, is dead). The
  live secret lives only in Supabase Edge Functions → Secrets → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- Bundle is now ~1.41 MB (supabase-js); code-splitting still deferred.

## Decisions locked
1. **Sequencing:** phase it, **content first**. Phase 1 = content + grammar + leveled quizzes
   (100% client-side, ships alone). Phase 2 = Supabase auth + cloud sync + AI writing eval.
2. **Business model:** free, guest-first, **monetize later**. Build a `tier` flag + usage counters
   + feature flags now so a paid tier drops in with no rewrite. No B2B/multi-tenant yet.
3. **AI cost posture:** shoestring. Claude **Haiku only** in production; Gemini Flash / gpt-4o-mini
   are fallbacks **only on hard failure**. Aggressive caching by input hash. ~3–5 reviews/user/day.
   Monthly spend cap with **auto-shutoff**. Target: low single-digit $/month at hundreds of users.
4. **Writing engine:** hybrid — hosted **LanguageTool** categorizes errors (often no LLM call
   needed); one LLM call only to prioritise/phrase the single biggest weakness.
5. **Auth/data:** **full cloud sync** — anonymous guest + email/OAuth; progress moves to Supabase
   Postgres; guest→account upgrade preserves data.
6. **Vocabulary architecture:** **NO RAG / no vector DB.** Curated static dataset, expanded only
   from open-licensed sources (Tatoeba CC-BY, Wiktionary/Wikidata CC-BY-SA, DWDS/Leipzig freq).
   Goethe Wortlisten, Routledge, and Klett textbooks are copyrighted → excluded.
7. **Infra ownership:** founder provides the Supabase project + Anthropic key (optional Gemini/
   OpenAI fallback keys) + hosted LanguageTool key + a monthly spend ceiling. Keys live in Supabase
   Edge Function secrets, never in the browser.


## Founder action items
- [x] Create a Supabase project; share URL + publishable key. (`stkfdavpjflpqoxjunnj`, committed)
- [x] Provide Anthropic (Claude) API key. (set in Supabase secrets as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- [x] Decide the monthly AI spend ceiling. (**$5/month**, enforced in the function)
- [x] Apply schema via SQL editor. (done 2026-05-31)
- [x] Enable Anonymous sign-in. (done; email also enabled — **must stay ON**: guest flow, AI
      writing coach `lib/writing.ts`, and guest→account upgrade all depend on it.)
- [x] **Disable "Confirm email"** so sign-up logs in instantly. (done 2026-06-01 — banner now clears
      on sign-up, founder-verified.)
- [x] Set Site URL in Auth settings. (done)
- [x] Deploy `evaluate-writing` function via dashboard code editor. (done 2026-05-31)
- [x] Smoke-test end-to-end. (✅ working — spelling insight returned correctly)
- [x] **Rotate the Anthropic key** (the one pasted in chat) — done; new key set in Supabase Edge
      Functions → Secrets → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- [ ] (Optional) Add Resend SMTP to fix email magic-link rate-limit. Auth → SMTP settings.
- [ ] (Optional) Enable Turnstile CAPTCHA on guest sign-in to deter bot abuse before public launch.
- [ ] (Optional) Get a hosted LanguageTool key (free tier) for better grammar pre-checks.
- [ ] **Google sign-in branding verification — awaiting async Google review (re-submitted s22):**
      The blocking technical issue ("home page does not explain purpose") is fixed: `index.html`
      now contains a full static pre-render inside `#root` that Google's no-JS HTML crawler can read.
      Founder re-submitted via Google Cloud Console → OAuth consent screen → "I have fixed the issues."
      The cached dialog still shows the old failure (that is the previous attempt's result, not a new
      evaluation). Google's async re-review takes hours to days; the founder should wait for an email
      from Google's Trust and Safety team. **Do NOT re-click "I have fixed the issues" again while
      waiting.** If the email says issues remain, escalate via the Google Developer forums or reply
      to the Trust and Safety email with the raw-HTML evidence (the static text is visible in
      `view-source:https://genauly.de`).

## Deploy / workflow reminders
- `main` is production; merging to it triggers `pages.yml` (the **only** workflow now — the old
  `deploy.yml`/`gh-pages` fallback is gone). Develop on the automation branch assigned for the session
  (reassigned each session; `main` is always the source of truth); ship via
  squash-merge PR. **Always verify `pnpm build` is green on the exact commit before merging**
  (a skipped check shipped two broken builds in session 2).
- **Feature-branch pushes are NOT live.** Only `main` deploys. In session 3 the founder reported
  "I don't see any change" because the dark-mode commits were pushed to the branch but never merged.
  **Auto-ship preference (founder approved 2026-06-01): when a change is done and the build is green,
  open + squash-merge the PR yourself without asking** — see CLAUDE.md.
- **REQUIRED post-deploy housekeeping (after every squash-merge):** realign the dev branch so it
  doesn't drift and conflict on the next PR — `git fetch origin main` → `git reset --hard origin/main`
  → `git push --force-with-lease origin claude/vibrant-meitner-mfl9xk`. (Forgetting this caused the
  PR #23 merge conflict.) Full checklist in CLAUDE.md → "Post-deploy GitHub housekeeping".
- Sandbox can't reach the live site or run Docker (so no local Supabase / no live verification
  here) — those steps are handed to the founder, same as the Pages deploy.


## Resume here (next session)

**Handoff after session 70 (2026-07-06). UX redesign Phase 4 is COMPLETE ✅: Session C shipped
tasks 4.5 (visible progression chip, PR TBD) and 4.6 (this gates/docs wrap), closing out Phase 4
(plan: `docs/plans/UX_REDESIGN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`).** What 4.5 shipped:
- **`src/lib/phase.ts` (new):** `themePhase(ratio)` maps a theme's existing mastery ratio to a
  three-step **Aufbau → Festigen → Gemischt** label, reusing the app's two existing mastery bars
  (`< 0.4` = Aufbau, `< 0.8` = Festigen matching the city `LIT_THRESHOLD`/engine `masteryLabel`
  bands, `>= 0.8` = Gemischt matching the `mastery() >= 0.8` "mastered" bar). Pure derived function,
  **no new state**: both call sites already compute the ratio.
- **Fortschritt theme grid** (`features/analytics/Analytics.tsx`, "Beherrschung nach Thema" card):
  each theme row now shows a phase `Badge` (muted/accent/success per phase) next to the theme title.
- **City-building tap** (`components/city/CityStrip.tsx`): the accessible label and hover title on
  each lit building now include the phase (e.g. "Büro · Festigen"), alongside the existing percentage.
- **Gates (4.6):** all green — `build`, `typecheck`, `lint` (0 errors), `lint:content`, `test:unit`
  **62** (unchanged, no new test surface for a pure derived-label helper), `test:srs` 323 checks,
  `test:pronounce` 26 checks, `check:bundle` main chunk **79.0 kB**.

**Next step:** Phase 4 (typed recall + authentic input + progression visibility) is done. The
founder's standing priority call stands: pivot to the game plan G1 (`docs/plans/GAME_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
still PROPOSED), whose formCloze / dialogue-battle scenes build on 4.1's tolerant typed grading, 4.2's
typed-block pattern, and 4.4's authentic-input block pattern; or pick the next item off the founder
backlog in `docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md`.

---

**Handoff after session 69 (2026-07-06). UX redesign Phase 4 Session B is COMPLETE ✅: tasks 4.3
(Lesen/Hören text bank, PR #320 `f09da8e`) AND 4.4 (reading/listening composer block + renderer, PR #322
`98c4688`) shipped, so authentic reading/listening input is now live in the composed session (plan:
`docs/plans/UX_REDESIGN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`).** What 4.4 shipped:
- **New `kind: "reading"` `SessionBlock`** (`src/types/index.ts`): `textId` + a `listening` flag.
- **Composer** (`src/engine/session.ts`): Pool 6 emits **exactly one** reading block per session; prefers a
  text on the scoped/weak theme, else one in the active Mode lens, else any. A voicemail text plays as a
  **listening** variant when the caller reports TTS (new pure `listening` opt, player passes
  `ttsSupported()`); every other genre renders as readable text. `test:unit` gained 3 composer cases.
- **`ReadingBlock` renderer** (`src/features/session/ReadingBlock.tsx`, new — extracted so `SessionPlayer`
  stays under the ~1000-line line the plan flagged): a two-stage full-screen focus block. Read/listen stage
  (genre + CEFR badges, tap-gloss title, `Übersetzung` toggle; listening = TTS play/replay with a
  `Text anzeigen` reveal fallback), then the 2–3 comprehension MCQs one at a time (reuses the quiz MCQ
  styling + `explain`). `XP.readingCheck` (8) per correct check; the block registers ONE aggregate tally
  result (majority-correct) at completion, so it never inflates correct/total, and it **never touches vocab
  FSRS** (comprehension practice, not a graded SRS card — keeps 4.5's "no new state" invariant intact).
- **Gates:** all green — `build`, `typecheck`, `lint` (0 errors), `lint:content`, `test:unit` **62**,
  `check:bundle` main chunk **78.9 kB** (bank + renderer ride the lazy session-route chunk).

**Next step:** short Session C = **4.5** (visible per-theme progression chip on the Fortschritt theme grid
+ city-building tap, derived from existing FSRS/theme-mastery state, **no new state** — Sonnet) + **4.6**
(gates/docs wrap). OR the standing alternative: pivot to game plan G1 (`GAME_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, still
PROPOSED), whose formCloze / dialogue-battle scenes now have the tolerant typed grading (4.1), the typed
block pattern (4.2), and the authentic-input block pattern (4.4) to build on.
