# Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-07-27 (session 173). **A deploy can no longer refresh a learner's work away.**
The PWA's auto-update reload now waits while any surface holds unsaved work (`src/lib/liveWork.ts`),
and both kinds of work persist so even an unavoidable reload is recoverable: writing drafts autosave
per mode (`draftAutosave.ts`), and a running Üben session snapshots its plan + position
(`sessionResume.ts`). **Merged (PR #740).** Prior s172: the correction now appears in the Kurz/Lang trainer, rendered from
ONE shared module (`src/features/writing/correction.tsx`) with Fokus, Kurz/Lang and Verlauf
(PR #739). `docs/plans/SCHREIBEN-OVERHAUL.md` carries the writing-content roadmap.
`.github/workflows/supabase.yml` deploys Edge Functions on merge, so backend changes no longer need
a CLI. Product name: **Genauly** (`genauly.de`)._

This is the **lean, living** status doc: current state plus the two most recent session handoffs.
**Start at the `## Resume here (next session)` section at the end.** Companion files:
- **`docs/PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md`** — the stable technical baseline that rarely changes: shipped
  architecture (Phase 1/2), locked architectural decisions, backend/infra, and completed founder
  action items. Read it when you need the "what's built and how" detail that used to sit here.
- **`docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md`** — stable reference: the founder backlog, product-evaluation
  findings, per-session model guidance, and reusable research findings.
- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — the "why" behind locked UX decisions.
- **`docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`** — index into the append-only session-log history,
  chunked by ISO week under `docs/archive/status-log/`.
- **`../CLAUDE.md`** — the lean always-on operating rules (restructured s155, ~180 lines); deep
  per-area detail lives in **`docs/areas/`** (COMMANDS, CONTENT, BIBLIOTHEK, SESSION, SCHREIBEN,
  PRAKTISCH-NAV, GAME, BRAND, LEGAL-ADMIN, COMPONENTS) + the `/design` and `/content` skills.

**Doc-hygiene rule (keep this file lean):** hold only **current state + the two most recent
handoffs**. When you append a new handoff to `## Resume here`, move any handoff older than the two
most recent into the current ISO-week chunk under `docs/archive/status-log/` (see the index at
`docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`). Do NOT let the `_Last updated_` block above grow into a
session-by-session narrative — keep it to the latest session only. Keep the whole file under ~250
lines. Stable "what's built" material goes to `PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md`, not here.

## Where things stand

The full SPA is live on `main`: onboarding, dashboard, the composed session loop, the four-zone nav
(Praktisch · Bibliothek · Schreiben · Fortschritt), the Neuland game layer (`/welt`, Kapitel 1
complete), Supabase auth + cloud sync, and the AI writing coach. **The shipped architecture, locked
architectural decisions, and backend/infra setup are documented in `docs/PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md`** —
read that for the "what's built and how." The living detail of every feature area (mobile bar, the
session engine, Bibliothek views, the game layer, content conventions) is in `docs/areas/` (index
in `../CLAUDE.md`).

**Content banks (as of 2026-07-21, session 142, verified against `pnpm lint:content` — re-verify
before quoting):** vocab **1,623** (8 mis-filed noun+verb combos retired from the Wörter surface
in s142, ids kept) · collocations **1,035** · Redemittel **149** ·
grammar **24 topics / 117 drills** · Lese-/Hörtexte **36** · Can-Do **52** · provenance **3,107
rows** · themes **20** (five new `alltag` themes in s126: einkaufen/essen/mobilitaet/freizeit/
digitales) · exam sets **15** · dialogues **30**. Taxonomy is **5 top-level domains** (the
`beruf`/`arbeitswelt` work split was merged into one `beruf` in s121), all populated. **Branche is a scope
since s102** (15 sectors, `sectors[]` multi-tag, untagged = universal) on Wörter + Kollokationen.
Standing governance debt: **all** provenance rows are AI-drafted and `draft`, none human-verified
(human verification was reset to zero on 2026-07-22 at founder request, to restart the review pass;
see `strategy/DATA_GOVERNANCE.md`).

## Open founder action items
Completed setup items are recorded in `docs/PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md`. The s147 Satzlabor redeploy is
done (s150: all three AI functions deployed on the Gemini-primary cascade, `GEMINI_API_KEY` set). Still open:
- [ ] (Optional) Add Resend SMTP to fix the email magic-link rate-limit. Auth → SMTP settings.
- [x] ~~Enable Turnstile CAPTCHA on guest sign-in.~~ **DONE 2026-07-24** (live sign-in verified; both
      Supabase Auth CAPTCHA and the `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` GitHub secret set). Details in
      `PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md`.
- [ ] (Optional) Get a hosted LanguageTool key (free tier) for better grammar pre-checks.
- [x] ~~Redeploy `transform-sentence` to activate the "Nochmal" regenerate button (s163).~~
      **DONE 2026-07-24** (founder redeployed via the Supabase dashboard; the capped variant path is
      live).
- [ ] **Google sign-in branding verification — awaiting async Google review (re-submitted s22):**
      The blocking technical issue ("home page does not explain purpose") is fixed: `index.html`
      now contains a full static pre-render inside `#root` that Google's no-JS HTML crawler can read.
      Founder re-submitted via Google Cloud Console → OAuth consent screen → "I have fixed the issues."
      Google's async re-review takes hours to days; wait for an email from Google's Trust and Safety
      team. **Do NOT re-click "I have fixed the issues" again while waiting.** If issues remain,
      escalate via the Google Developer forums with the raw-HTML evidence (visible in
      `view-source:https://genauly.de`).

## Resume here (next session)

**Handoff after session 173 (2026-07-27). The app no longer refreshes work away. Merged as PR #740
(`805fff0`), branch `claude/app-refresh-data-loss-01xd0e`.**
Founder bug report: "whenever the user is working on something like writing an email or practicing an
Übung session, the update takes place and the app refreshes", losing the draft or the session. Root
cause was `src/lib/swUpdate.ts`: when a new service worker took control it reloaded unconditionally,
either immediately (within 30s of load) or **at the next resume from the background**, which is
exactly the moment a learner returns to a half-written email. Fixed in two layers:
- **Layer 1, never reload over live work.** New `src/lib/liveWork.ts` is a tiny module-level registry
  (not a store: the reloaders run outside React). A surface holding unsaved in-memory work claims it
  via the `useLiveWork(active, label, flush)` hook; `hasLiveWork()` gates every automatic reload, so
  a queued deploy simply waits and retries on each later resume. The app runs fine on the old bundle
  meanwhile. Claimants today: the Fokus / Kurz / Lang editors (non-empty text) and a running Üben run.
- **Layer 2, make any unavoidable reload recoverable.** Some reloads must still happen (a chunk-load
  self-heal in `lib/recover.ts`, a manual refresh, iOS discarding the tab), so work now persists:
  - `src/features/writing/draftAutosave.ts` (localStorage, one draft PER mode, 7-day TTL) autosaves
    500ms after the last keystroke and on unmount/pagehide, and restores on mount. It is deliberately
    a **separate key and record** from `resumeDraft.ts`: that one is the sign-in hand-off with the
    `resume: true` flag AppShell redirects on, and an autosave must never trigger that redirect.
  - `src/features/session/sessionResume.ts` (**sessionStorage**, keyed by a signature of the launch
    params, 3h TTL) snapshots plan + index + tallies + loot. sessionStorage on purpose: it survives a
    reload of the tab but dies with it, so a learner who opens Üben tomorrow gets a fresh session,
    never a silent resume. The snapshot always points at the next **unanswered** block, since an
    answered one is already graded into FSRS/XP and replaying it would double-count. Cleared on
    finish, on "Beenden", and on "Neue Runde" (with an `abandoned` ref so the unmount flush cannot
    write it back).
- `installLiveWorkFlush()` in `main.tsx` flushes every claim on pagehide / beforeunload / hidden, so
  even a reload nobody asked for lands on the restore path.
- `tests/liveWork.test.ts` (18 cases) pins the registry, per-mode draft isolation, staleness, corrupt
  storage, and that a snapshot never resumes into a differently-scoped session.
- **Not verifiable from the sandbox:** service-worker update behavior needs the live site. What the
  founder should see after the deploy: backgrounding the app mid-draft and returning no longer wipes
  the editor, and a refresh restores both the text and its Aufgabe. Hard-refresh once first, since a
  stale service worker can still serve the pre-fix build for one launch.
- **Worth knowing for the next reload-ish change:** the rule is now a CLAUDE.md hard invariant, so any
  new surface that holds in-memory work must both claim `useLiveWork` AND persist itself. Persisting
  alone is not enough (the reload still throws away the on-screen state around the draft), and
  claiming alone is not enough (a chunk-load self-heal ignores no-one's convenience).
- **Deliberately NOT done:** no "a new version is available, reload?" toast. The founder's report was
  about interruption, and a banner is a second interruption; the queued-update-on-next-safe-resume
  path ships the same deploy without asking anything of the learner. Revisit only if a deploy ever
  needs to be forced out mid-session (e.g. a broken backend contract).

**Handoff after session 172 (2026-07-27). The correction in Kurz/Lang (founder pick A), merged as
PR #739.**
Prompt 13/14 built and re-shared `preview/kurz-lang-korrektur.html` (three places for the correction:
A im Schreibfeld · B alles im Ergebnis · C zum Aufklappen, bottom cluster + Aufgabe card held identical
across all three). The founder picked **A** and asked to "make sure both the tiles are harmonious with
Fokus design", which was literal: the round-1 tiles lacked Fokus's `→`, and the Verlauf copies had
drifted too (em dash where Fokus prints `∅`).
- **ONE correction language:** the Fokus pieces now live in `src/features/writing/correction.tsx`
  (`useCorrectionDiff`, `CorrectionToggle`, `MarkedTokens`, `MarkedParagraphs`, `FixTiles` with optional
  `max` + `action`), and Fokus desktop, Kurz/Lang and Verlauf all render from it, so a fourth copy
  cannot drift. `tests/correction.test.tsx` pins the tile anatomy. Fokus MOBILE keeps its own
  two-column list (measured height, founder r4 amendment); Kurz/Lang shows tiles at both breakpoints
  because its result page scrolls anyway.
- **Kurz/Lang variant A:** the editor card becomes the correction card once a result lands. "Neu
  schreiben" rides the tile row at `lg` (the Fokus "Neuer Satz" spot) and Auswerten drops out there
  while a correction is up (it would only re-serve the cached verdict); the mobile cluster is
  untouched. Any result WITHOUT a correction (error-free, templated spelling verdict, failure, limit)
  keeps the plain field, so fixing and resubmitting still works. `useFillEditor` measures the bottom
  clearance FIRST, so the field-less state still reserves the fixed chrome, and releases the Aufgabe cap
  there. **No backend change:** `corrected` has been in the evaluate-writing response, cache included,
  since s171.
- **`classifyChange` gained "Kasus & Artikel"**: "in meine Wohnung → in meiner Wohnung" was labelled
  Rechtschreibung, i.e. the tile taught the wrong rule on the most common B1/B2 mistake. Both sides must
  be in a closed article/possessive/determiner set, so "das → dass" stays Rechtschreibung and a
  case-only change stays Groß-/Kleinschreibung.
- **Verification pattern worth reusing:** `preview/gen-kurz-lang-korrektur-r2.mjs` SSR-renders the REAL
  components (via Vite `ssrLoadModule` + `react-dom/server`) beside the Fokus card and inlines the app's
  built CSS, so a preview sheet cannot flatter the implementation. Emits light, dark and an
  artifact-body variant (artifact `575786f8`). Note this sandbox has the Chromium binary at
  `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome` but NO playwright module, so screenshots go
  through `chrome --headless --screenshot`.
- **Gates:** typecheck · lint 0 errors · test:unit **327/327** · build · check:bundle 118.4 kB.
- **Next:** the founder verifies the live result (Pages deploy from the squash-merge of #739). Open
  question they may raise: the round-1 mock drew "Kasus üben" in the phone's bottom row, which the
  shipped cluster does not do (the practice CTA stays inside the result card); changing that touches the
  locked cluster and needs an explicit ask.
