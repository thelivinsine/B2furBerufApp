# Project Status & Decision Log

_Last updated: 2026-07-08 (session 82: **Neuland game visuals fix. The `terminal` and `laden` scene
settings (16 of Chapter 1's scenes) rendered as blank paper stages, the founder reported "no game visuals".
Authored code-authored placeholder backdrops for both (transit hall + shop) in `welt_assets.py`, wired
into `SETTING_ART`. Shipped PR #368.** Prior, session 81: **G2 kicked off, founder gave the go. Authored
the rest of Neuland Kapitel 1 (missions 1.1–1.5); Chapter 1 now complete end-to-end (6 missions, 1.1→1.6 boss).**
Earlier, session 80: **top-value tasks + daily-life depth + SEO, 4 PRs to `main`**.
**#360** closed EU AI Act #21 (documented Art. 6(3) risk assessment `docs/strategy/AI_ACT_RISK_ASSESSMENT.md`;
not-high-risk/limited-risk) and shipped the full SEO surface (Open Graph + Twitter + canonical + JSON-LD
WebApplication/FAQPage in `index.html`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, landing FAQ + how-it-works) plus 4
daily-life reading texts. **#361** added 5 daily-life exam sets (exam-prep parity across all life domains).
**#362** added a 2nd branching dialogue per newest daily-life theme (dialogues 16→20). **#363** added a
real 1200×630 OG share image (`public/og-image.png`, generator `preview/og-image/make-og.mjs`). Counts now:
642 vocab · 540 collocations · 22 texts/66 checks · 15 exam sets · 20 dialogues · 1,421 provenance rows.
Prior, session 78: **data strategy Phase B + Phase C SHIPPED** (Layer 3 linguistic engine `verify:grammar`
+ `verify:cefr`, warn-only; Phase C trust model → generated `src/data/verification.ts`, `/sources` tier
badge; `DATA_STRATEGY.md` → v1.4). Prior, session 75: **four daily-life content packs shipped** (Arzt,
Wohnen, Bank, Bildung), themes now 15 (was 11), **all six top-level domains populated**.
**G2 is GO (founder greenlit 2026-07-08, session 81)**: zero-spend, incremental, playtest-first. The
parked groundwork branch `claude/neuland-g1-g2-feedback-wkf28n` was NOT rebased (189 files, badly diverged
since s74); instead the two draft missions (1.1/1.2) were extracted and re-authored against current `main`.
The working branch is reassigned every session, so **`main` is always the source of truth**. Product name:
**Genauly** (domain `genauly.de`)._

This file is the **lean, living** status doc: current state plus the two most recent session handoffs.
Start at the `## Resume here (next session)` section near the end. Companion files:
- **`docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md`** — stable reference that rarely changes: the founder backlog,
  the product-evaluation findings, per-session model guidance, and reusable research findings.
- **`docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`** — index into the append-only history, chunked by ISO week
  under `docs/archive/status-log/` (sessions 1–72 + an `ops-notes` file).
- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — the "why" behind locked decisions. Full design: `docs/archive/EXPANSION_PLAN.md`.

**Doc-hygiene rule (keep this file lean):** when you append a new handoff to `## Resume here`, move any
handoff older than the two most recent into the current ISO-week chunk under `docs/archive/status-log/`
(see the index at `docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`). Keep this file under ~250 lines. This split
was done in session 70 (the file had grown to 1,624 lines / 140 kB).

## Who I'm working with
- **Founder is non-technical.** Operate as a seasoned CTO: be decisive and opinionated, minimize
  the founder's operational burden, protect them from surprise costs, and aim for an award-worthy,
  genuinely useful product — not just feature parity.

## Where things stand

### Original SPA — live (on `main`)
- Full client-side SPA: onboarding, dashboard, vocabulary (flashcards/quiz/list), redemittel
  (browse + practice), branching simulations, timed exam mode, analytics, settings.
- Engines: SRS (`engine/srs.ts`; SM-2 originally, swapped to FSRS-6 in s53 / PR #275), XP/levels/tiers
  (`engine/scoring.ts`), Web Speech TTS/STT (`engine/speech.ts`), branching dialogue runner
  (`engine/dialogue.ts`).
- State: zustand stores persisted to localStorage (`b2beruf.progress.v1`, `b2beruf.settings.v1`).

### Phase 1 — SHIPPED & LIVE ✅ (on `main` via `pages.yml`, founder-verified 2026-05-30)
- **Types (1A):** `GrammarTopic`/`GrammarDrill`/`GrammarGroup`, `Collocation`, leveled
  `QuizQuestion` union (`MCQQuestion`/`WordOrderQuestion`/`MatchingQuestion`), `PracticeArea`
  + `WeaknessCategory` — all in `src/types/index.ts`.
- **Engine (1B):** `src/engine/quiz.ts` `buildThemeQuiz(themeId, difficulty, count)` generates
  mixed sets from vocab/collocations/grammar banks; reuses SRS (`reviewVocab`) + scoring.
  Added `XP.quizEasy/quizMedium/quizHard/grammarDrill`.
- **Content (1C):** `src/data/collocations.ts` (**396** Nomen-Verb pairs, ~36/theme);
  `src/data/grammar.ts` rewritten to **11 `GrammarTopic`s** w/ drills (Konnektoren, Relativsätze,
  da-/wo-Wörter, Verbstellung/TeKaMoLo, Nebensätze, Kasus, Nomen-Verb, K-II, Modal, Passiv);
  `redemittel.ts` grown to **72**; **10 connectors** added to vocab (**304** words);
  `src/data/practiceAreas.ts` weakness→deep-link registry.
- **UI (1D):** `/grammar` (`features/grammar/GrammarHub` + `GrammarDrillCard`) and `/quiz`
  (`features/quiz/QuizHub` + `QuizRunner`), both query-param driven (`?topic=`, `?theme=&level=`).
  Wired into Sidebar, router (guarded), and Dashboard daily-module tiles.
- **Verified live:** Grammar topics + drills and the leveled theme quizzes work on the deployed
  Pages site; `npm run build` green; no duplicate ids.

### Branding — DONE (live)
- App named **Genauly**, tagline **"German for real life"** (header, sidebar, onboarding,
  `<title>`/meta, `package.json` description, PWA manifest). Custom domain **genauly.de** (CNAME shipped).
  Tagline was updated from the old "German that clicks" across all six surfaces in session 22 (PR #145).
- **Default logo (locked 2026-06-08):** the **rounded gradient "G" with transparent corners**.
  The canonical file is **`public/genauly-default-logo-transparent-corners.png`** and it is the
  default logo in every in-app spot (sign-in dialog, mobile header, desktop sidebar, landing,
  onboarding, `/privacy`). Favicon uses PNG files (`public/favicon-32.png`, `public/favicon-16.png`)
  generated from the real logo (replacing the old `favicon.svg` which rendered a plain system-font "G").
  `public/pwa-*.png` and `apple-touch-icon.png` are **full-bleed opaque** (no transparent corners)
  so iOS home-screen icons don't show dark corners on the OS rounding mask.
  - **Do NOT make the in-app logo full-bleed.** A full-bleed square variant exists **only** for
    Google's OAuth consent screen (its circular crop shows white through transparent corners). It
    is not committed to the repo and must not replace the app logo. (Full-bleed-everywhere was
    shipped then reverted in PRs #120/#121 — keep the app on the rounded transparent logo.)

### Phase 2 — SHIPPED & LIVE ✅ (squash-merged to `main` 2026-05-31, founder-verified)
- Supabase auth + cloud sync + AI writing eval fully deployed and smoke-tested by founder.
- **Supabase project:** `stkfdavpjflpqoxjunnj`. Publishable key committed in
  `src/lib/supabaseConfig.ts` (safe — all tables owner-only RLS). Service-role key and Anthropic
  key live only in Supabase Edge Function secrets (never in the repo or browser).
- **2A schema:** applied via Supabase dashboard SQL editor — `profiles`, `progress`,
  `writing_evaluations`, `ai_usage`, owner-only RLS, auto-provision trigger on auth.users,
  `bump_ai_usage` atomic RPC. `profiles.tier` flag present (monetization-ready).
- **2B auth + sync:** `useAuthStore` (guest anon sign-in + email magic-link); `cloudSync.ts`
  (offline-first: localStorage stays cache, pull+MERGE on login, debounced write-through).
  `AccountPanel` shown in Settings. **Guest sign-in works and is the primary path.**
  Email sign-in works when clicked through but has rate-limit issues on Supabase's free SMTP
  (fix: add Resend SMTP in Auth settings — deferred).
- **2C writing UI:** `/writing` route live; short/long tasks per theme; one insight card + "Üben"
  deep-link via `practiceAreas` registry. Added to Sidebar + Dashboard daily modules.
- **2D edge function:** `evaluate-writing` deployed via Supabase dashboard code editor (NOT CLI —
  sandbox network blocks `api.supabase.com`). Daily limit (5/day) + monthly auto-shutoff ($5 cap)
  + input-hash cache + LanguageTool pre-check (templated spelling path = no LLM cost) + one Haiku
  call fallback chain. **Verified working end-to-end** — founder test returned correct spelling
  insight with "Rechtschreibung üben" deep-link.
- **Known deployment quirk:** the Supabase dashboard pre-fills a "Hello [name]!" boilerplate when
  creating a function. Must select-all-delete before pasting the real code. Caught and fixed.
- **Anthropic key:** ✅ rotated by the founder (the original, once pasted in chat, is dead). The
  live secret lives only in Supabase Edge Functions → Secrets → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- Bundle is now ~1.41 MB (supabase-js); code-splitting still deferred.

## Decisions locked
1. **Sequencing:** phase it, **content first**. Phase 1 = content + grammar + leveled quizzes
   (100% client-side, ships alone). Phase 2 = Supabase auth + cloud sync + AI writing eval.
2. **Business model:** free, guest-first, **monetize later**. Build a `tier` flag + usage counters
   + feature flags now so a paid tier drops in with no rewrite. No B2B/multi-tenant yet.
3. **AI cost posture:** shoestring. Claude **Haiku only** in production; Gemini Flash / gpt-4o-mini
   are fallbacks **only on hard failure**. Aggressive caching by input hash. ~3–5 reviews/user/day.
   Monthly spend cap with **auto-shutoff**. Target: low single-digit $/month at hundreds of users.
4. **Writing engine:** hybrid — hosted **LanguageTool** categorizes errors (often no LLM call
   needed); one LLM call only to prioritise/phrase the single biggest weakness.
5. **Auth/data:** **full cloud sync** — anonymous guest + email/OAuth; progress moves to Supabase
   Postgres; guest→account upgrade preserves data.
6. **Vocabulary architecture:** **NO RAG / no vector DB.** Curated static dataset, expanded only
   from open-licensed sources (Tatoeba CC-BY, Wiktionary/Wikidata CC-BY-SA, DWDS/Leipzig freq).
   Goethe Wortlisten, Routledge, and Klett textbooks are copyrighted → excluded.
7. **Infra ownership:** founder provides the Supabase project + Anthropic key (optional Gemini/
   OpenAI fallback keys) + hosted LanguageTool key + a monthly spend ceiling. Keys live in Supabase
   Edge Function secrets, never in the browser.


## Founder action items
- [x] Create a Supabase project; share URL + publishable key. (`stkfdavpjflpqoxjunnj`, committed)
- [x] Provide Anthropic (Claude) API key. (set in Supabase secrets as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- [x] Decide the monthly AI spend ceiling. (**$5/month**, enforced in the function)
- [x] Apply schema via SQL editor. (done 2026-05-31)
- [x] Enable Anonymous sign-in. (done; email also enabled — **must stay ON**: guest flow, AI
      writing coach `lib/writing.ts`, and guest→account upgrade all depend on it.)
- [x] **Disable "Confirm email"** so sign-up logs in instantly. (done 2026-06-01 — banner now clears
      on sign-up, founder-verified.)
- [x] Set Site URL in Auth settings. (done)
- [x] Deploy `evaluate-writing` function via dashboard code editor. (done 2026-05-31)
- [x] Smoke-test end-to-end. (✅ working — spelling insight returned correctly)
- [x] **Rotate the Anthropic key** (the one pasted in chat) — done; new key set in Supabase Edge
      Functions → Secrets → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- [ ] (Optional) Add Resend SMTP to fix email magic-link rate-limit. Auth → SMTP settings.
- [ ] (Optional) Enable Turnstile CAPTCHA on guest sign-in to deter bot abuse before public launch.
- [ ] (Optional) Get a hosted LanguageTool key (free tier) for better grammar pre-checks.
- [ ] **Google sign-in branding verification — awaiting async Google review (re-submitted s22):**
      The blocking technical issue ("home page does not explain purpose") is fixed: `index.html`
      now contains a full static pre-render inside `#root` that Google's no-JS HTML crawler can read.
      Founder re-submitted via Google Cloud Console → OAuth consent screen → "I have fixed the issues."
      The cached dialog still shows the old failure (that is the previous attempt's result, not a new
      evaluation). Google's async re-review takes hours to days; the founder should wait for an email
      from Google's Trust and Safety team. **Do NOT re-click "I have fixed the issues" again while
      waiting.** If the email says issues remain, escalate via the Google Developer forums or reply
      to the Trust and Safety email with the raw-HTML evidence (the static text is visible in
      `view-source:https://genauly.de`).

## Deploy / workflow reminders
- `main` is production; merging to it triggers `pages.yml` (the **only** workflow now — the old
  `deploy.yml`/`gh-pages` fallback is gone). Develop on the automation branch assigned for the session
  (reassigned each session; `main` is always the source of truth); ship via
  squash-merge PR. **Always verify `pnpm build` is green on the exact commit before merging**
  (a skipped check shipped two broken builds in session 2).
- **Feature-branch pushes are NOT live.** Only `main` deploys. In session 3 the founder reported
  "I don't see any change" because the dark-mode commits were pushed to the branch but never merged.
  **Auto-ship preference (founder approved 2026-06-01): when a change is done and the build is green,
  open + squash-merge the PR yourself without asking** — see CLAUDE.md.
- **REQUIRED post-deploy housekeeping (after every squash-merge):** realign the dev branch so it
  doesn't drift and conflict on the next PR — `git fetch origin main` → `git reset --hard origin/main`
  → `git push --force-with-lease origin claude/vibrant-meitner-mfl9xk`. (Forgetting this caused the
  PR #23 merge conflict.) Full checklist in CLAUDE.md → "Post-deploy GitHub housekeeping".
- Sandbox can't reach the live site or run Docker (so no local Supabase / no live verification
  here) — those steps are handed to the founder, same as the Pages deploy.


## Resume here (next session)

**Handoff after session 82 (2026-07-08). Neuland game-visuals fix (branch `claude/missing-game-visuals-qcmde6`).**
The founder sent screenshots of the game (`/welt`) showing "no game visuals": the Willkommen passport battle
and the Fahrkarten-Automat cutscene rendered over a blank beige stage. **Root cause:** `SETTING_ART` in
`src/features/welt/stage.tsx` mapped `terminal` and `laden` to `null`, so the two most-used Chapter-1
settings (8 scenes each, 16 total) had no backdrop. G2's licensed pixel-art packs were still pending, and
the interim left those stages blank rather than placeholder-filled.
- **Fix (PR #368, squash-merged):** authored two backdrops in `preview/game-pixel-mockups/welt_assets.py`
  in the blessed scene-7 pixel language, a new polished-tile floor helper for public spaces: **`terminal`**
  (transit hall: split-flap departure board, passport/service counter under the battle-opponent spot,
  self-service ticket machine, direction sign) and **`laden`** (shop: stocked product shelves, checkout
  counter with register + card terminal, sale poster). Regenerated `terminal.png`/`laden.png`, wired both
  into `SETTING_ART`. `website` stays `null` on purpose (`WebsiteView` draws its own browser chrome).
- **Gates green:** `pnpm build`, `check:bundle` (83 kB, game stays lazy). Founder confirmed the deploy
  rendered correctly (screenshot of the Fahrkarten-Automat with the transit-hall backdrop).
- **Follow-up Q&A (no code):** clarified the roadmap, walking is G3 (Phaser overworld, playtest-gated), the
  battle scenes are staged React tableaux by design (not walkable); only the loadout scene walks today. G2
  is **in progress**, not complete: recurring-mission composer, fetch-quest loop, and the Supabase game-state
  migration remain. Recommended doing those in a fresh session (different subsystem, wants plan-first).

**Handoff after session 81 (2026-07-08). G2 kicked off: founder greenlit the game build (zero-spend,
incremental, playtest-first), and Neuland Kapitel 1 is now COMPLETE end-to-end.** After a Q&A on the game
roadmap and the G2 cost boundary (only paid items are optional pixel-art packs + Aseprite, ~30–60 EUR
one-time; free path exists), the founder said go, then "go ahead with 1.3 to 1.5". Shipped in two PRs:
- **PR #365 (increment 1):** ported the parked drafts **1.1 "Willkommen in Neuland"** (airport arrival,
  passport-control battle, station-announcement listening, meet Jonas) and **1.2 "Der Fahrkarten-Automat"**
  (ticket-machine battle, Zone-AB lesson) onto current `main`. Did NOT rebase the parked branch
  `claude/neuland-g1-g2-feedback-wkf28n` (189 files, badly diverged since s74); extracted only the two
  missions and re-authored against the current schema.
- **Increment 2:** authored fresh **1.3 "Die SIM-Karte"** (phone-shop upsell battle vs Milo, resist the
  Vertrag, tariff-page parody, `ki_sim_vertrag`), **1.4 "Der erste Einkauf"** (Leergutautomat/Pfand parody
  + the legendary checkout-speed battle vs the Kassiererin, `sustainability`-theme via the recycling angle),
  and **1.5 "Ein Dach über dem Kopf"** (landlord Herr Brandt polite-register battle + the Wohnungsgeberbestätigung
  form-cloze, grants `ki_wohnungsgeberbestaetigung`, sets up the boss's document chain).
- **Schema:** two small contained additions across the session, a `terminal` setting (airport/station) and a
  `laden` setting (shop), plus an optional per-scene `label` caption override, all mirrored in
  `lint-content.mjs` + threaded through the renderers. Missions themselves stay pure data. Added NPCs
  `npc_beamter`/`npc_automat`/`npc_milo`/`npc_kassiererin`/`npc_herr_brandt`, key items
  `ki_reisepass`/`ki_fahrschein`/`ki_sim_vertrag`, 5 provenance rows (draft).
- **1.1–1.5 chain** via `requiresMissions` (1.2→1.3→1.4→1.5). The **boss (1.6) is deliberately left
  ungated** so the founder can jump straight to it for playtesting (a `tests/mission.test.ts` fixture pins
  this; do not gate the boss). Every mission has a scaffolded-retry lose path (failure-as-content, no lockout).
- **Gates green:** `lint:content` (6 missions / 35 scenes / 11 NPCs / 7 key items / 1426 rows), `build`,
  `check:bundle` (83 kB, game stays lazy), `test:unit` (85), `lint` (0 errors).

**G2 next rungs (not yet built):** the **FSRS-driven recurring-mission composer** (the scheduler brings a
mission variant back when its vocab is due) and the **failure-as-fetch-quest loop** (a missing key item spawns
its acquisition mission). (The `terminal`/`laden` backdrops that were blank are now filled with code-authored
placeholder art in s82, PR #368; licensed pixel-art packs remain the eventual upgrade.) **Prerequisite for
cloud-syncing game state:** the Supabase migration adding
`missions_done`/`key_items` columns (an unknown column fails the whole `progress` upsert; game state is
local-only until then). **Playtest gate is now reachable** (Kapitel 1 is complete): 5–10 real learners play
the chapter, and completion/return/"did they laugh" decides whether G3 (walkable city) proceeds. Founder
still verifies live and reviews the draft German.
