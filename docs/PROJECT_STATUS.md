# Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-07-20 (session 139). **Three small fixes shipped to `main`** (PRs #616, #617):
(1) the saved icon-size preview was corrected to show **Größer as the applied favicon/app-icon size**
(the shipped assets were already Größer since s138; only the misleading preview showed Randnah); (2)
exiting a Neuland mission launched from **Heute → Spielen** now returns to the Spielen tab (with the
Lernen/Spielen toggle) instead of stranding the learner on the toggle-less `/welt` hub; (3) the
**Kollokationen graph clusters were pulled tighter** (founder-picked "Am engsten": centroid pull
0.72, link 0.38, charge −34, collision r+1.5, ring 118+N·26) so the theme islands read as compact,
distinct clusters. Product name: **Genauly** (`genauly.de`)._

This is the **lean, living** status doc: current state plus the two most recent session handoffs.
**Start at the `## Resume here (next session)` section at the end.** Companion files:
- **`docs/PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md`** — the stable technical baseline that rarely changes: shipped
  architecture (Phase 1/2), locked architectural decisions, backend/infra, and completed founder
  action items. Read it when you need the "what's built and how" detail that used to sit here.
- **`docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md`** — stable reference: the founder backlog, product-evaluation
  findings, per-session model guidance, and reusable research findings.
- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — the "why" behind locked UX decisions.
- **`docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`** — index into the append-only session-log history,
  chunked by ISO week under `docs/archive/status-log/`.
- **`../CLAUDE.md`** — developer/agent operating instructions, content conventions, and locked designs.

**Doc-hygiene rule (keep this file lean):** hold only **current state + the two most recent
handoffs**. When you append a new handoff to `## Resume here`, move any handoff older than the two
most recent into the current ISO-week chunk under `docs/archive/status-log/` (see the index at
`docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`). Do NOT let the `_Last updated_` block above grow into a
session-by-session narrative — keep it to the latest session only. Keep the whole file under ~250
lines. Stable "what's built" material goes to `PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md`, not here.

## Where things stand

The full SPA is live on `main`: onboarding, dashboard, the composed session loop, the four-zone nav
(Heute · Bibliothek · Anwenden · Fortschritt), the Neuland game layer (`/welt`, Kapitel 1 complete),
Supabase auth + cloud sync, and the AI writing coach. **The shipped architecture, locked
architectural decisions, and backend/infra setup are documented in `docs/PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md`** —
read that for the "what's built and how." The living detail of every feature area (mobile bar, the
session engine, Bibliothek views, the game layer, content conventions) is in `../CLAUDE.md`.

**Content banks (as of 2026-07-18, session 130, verified against `pnpm lint:content` — re-verify
before quoting):** vocab **1,623** · collocations **1,033** · Redemittel **149** ·
grammar **24 topics / 117 drills** · Lese-/Hörtexte **36** · Can-Do **52** · provenance **~3,105
rows** · themes **20** (five new `alltag` themes in s126: einkaufen/essen/mobilitaet/freizeit/
digitales) · exam sets **15** · dialogues **30**. Taxonomy is **5 top-level domains** (the
`beruf`/`arbeitswelt` work split was merged into one `beruf` in s121), all populated. **Branche is a scope
since s102** (15 sectors, `sectors[]` multi-tag, untagged = universal) on Wörter + Kollokationen.
Standing governance debt: ~98% of provenance rows are AI-drafted, not yet human-verified (see
`strategy/DATA_GOVERNANCE.md`).

## Open founder action items
Completed setup items are recorded in `docs/PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md`. Still open:
- [ ] (Optional) Add Resend SMTP to fix the email magic-link rate-limit. Auth → SMTP settings.
- [ ] (Optional) Enable Turnstile CAPTCHA on guest sign-in to deter bot abuse before public launch.
- [ ] (Optional) Get a hosted LanguageTool key (free tier) for better grammar pre-checks.
- [ ] **Google sign-in branding verification — awaiting async Google review (re-submitted s22):**
      The blocking technical issue ("home page does not explain purpose") is fixed: `index.html`
      now contains a full static pre-render inside `#root` that Google's no-JS HTML crawler can read.
      Founder re-submitted via Google Cloud Console → OAuth consent screen → "I have fixed the issues."
      Google's async re-review takes hours to days; wait for an email from Google's Trust and Safety
      team. **Do NOT re-click "I have fixed the issues" again while waiting.** If issues remain,
      escalate via the Google Developer forums with the raw-HTML evidence (visible in
      `view-source:https://genauly.de`).

## Resume here (next session)

**Handoff after session 139 (2026-07-20). Three small fixes, branch
`claude/app-icon-favicon-update-gympjq`, all shipped to `main` (PRs #616, #617).** Founder-reported
issues, handled one prompt at a time:
- **Icon-size preview correction (#616):** the founder thought the app icon/favicon still showed the
  old **Randnah** (5% margin) size. The shipped assets were in fact already **Größer** (12% margin)
  since s138 — verified by measuring every committed PNG (mark ≈ 73–75% of the tile = 12% margin;
  Randnah would be ≈ 90%). The confusion came from the saved preview
  `preview/branding/artifacts/genauly-logo-v2-previews.html`, which still highlighted Randnah as
  "empfohlen" and rendered the home-screen mockup row at the 5% margin. Fixed the preview to mark
  Größer as applied and render the OS row at 12%. **No shipped asset changed.** If the live
  tab/home-screen icon still looks old it is PWA/browser cache (hard-refresh; re-add the PWA).
- **Mission-exit toggle fix (#616):** exiting a mission launched from Heute → Spielen stripped the
  `?mission=` param and left the learner on the standalone `/welt` hub, which has no Lernen/Spielen
  toggle. Now `SpielenHub` tags the deep link `&from=heute`, `Welt.tsx` navigates back to
  `/?tab=spielen` on exit when it sees that marker, and `Dashboard.tsx` opens on the Spielen tab for
  `?tab=spielen` (clearing the param on a manual switch). Direct `/welt` visits are unchanged.
- **Kollokationen graph — tighter clusters (#617):** founder asked to pull the nodes closer so the
  theme islands look better; generated a 3-option preview
  (`preview/collocation-graph-tightness.html` + generator `preview/gen-collocation-graph-tightness.mjs`,
  rendering the REAL bank through the shipped d3-force layout) and the founder picked **"Am engsten"**.
  `CollocationGraph.tsx` force block now: centroid pull (forceX/Y) **0.72** (was 0.38), link **0.38**
  (0.22), charge **−34/max200** (−55/240), collision **r+1.5** (r+3), centroid ring **118+N·26**
  (140+N·35). Pure builder unchanged, so `tests/collocationGraph.test.ts` (11) still passes; CLAUDE.md
  layout-recipe note refreshed.
- **Gates (each PR):** typecheck ✓ · build ✓ · check:bundle 110.5 kB ✓ · test:unit 219/219 (#616) /
  collocationGraph 11/11 (#617) ✓. Post-merge branch realigned to `main` both times. PWA caveat: the
  graph + icons are service-worker-cached; hard-refresh the live site.

**Handoff after session 138 (2026-07-20). Logo v2 rework (logos ONLY, founder-scoped), branch
`claude/logo-blue-contrast-xsfk19`, shipped to `main`.** The founder found the logo's Himmelblau
swipe too harsh against black/white and iterated through 8 artifact preview rounds (v2→v8) to a
finalized design, then said "finalize these logos and Randnah favicon, apply everywhere, logos
only." What shipped:
- **Swipe color: Himmel Soft `#8CDBFB`** on every logo asset. (Initially the `--accent` token was
  deliberately left at Himmelblau `#52C6F9`; a same-session follow-up prompt then applied Himmel
  Soft app-wide: `--accent: 197 93% 77%` in BOTH themes in `index.css`, plus the two fixed
  `#53C7F9` hexes on the landing (numbers-band gradient stop, decorative doodle stroke). The darker
  `--accent-ink` text variant and the CTA `--gradient-*` stops are different blues and stayed.
  `check:contrast` green; brand kit regenerated.)
- **Icons re-centered ("Größer", `TILE_MARGIN = 0.12`):** `build-logo-assets.mjs` now measures the
  mark's true bbox in-browser and centers it at a 12% margin (favicons/apple-touch/pwa; maskable at
  14% since the OS crops it). This fixes the founder-screenshotted "empty band above the g" app icon.
  (Started at 5% "Randnah"; the founder found that too big live and picked Größer in a follow-up.)
  Never revert to raw-coordinate centering.
- **Two-tone dark logos:** on dark grounds, artwork on the swipe is ink, off the swipe is white —
  in practice only the g splits (ink bowl, white descender). Light grounds stay all ink.
- **New lowercase wordmark** (`public/genauly-wordmark.png`/`-dark.png`, 548×138): "genauly" in
  the app's own Inter (variable, wght 800, −0.02em, rendered via embedded `@fontsource-variable/
  inter` woff2), swipe under "genau" with the exact v2 band geometry (−0.16em/+0.10em overhangs,
  0.12em/0.10em em-box insets, −2° tilt). Dark wordmark: word white, "enau" solid ink on the
  swipe, ONLY the g dual-tone (clip = swipe ∪ an e..u rect, avoids white slivers on letter
  bottoms).
- **`Logo.tsx` gained `variant="mark" | "wordmark"`**; wordmark placed in Sidebar, AuthDialog,
  Onboarding, HelpChrome, LegalChrome, landing footer, **landing header at ALL sizes** (the
  founder wants a first-time visitor to see the app NAME, not just the mark; sized `h-7 w-auto
  sm:h-8`), and the dark no-JS shells (`index.html`, `prerender-help.mjs` — the adjacent "Genauly"
  text spans were removed, the image IS the name). Only the mobile in-app `AppShell` header keeps
  the compact mark (s86 rule). **Gotcha fixed in review:** responsive *display* utilities
  (block/hidden) must wrap `<Logo>` in a container, never be passed into it (they override the
  internal `dark:` image swap); *height* utilities are safe to pass in (they apply to both theme
  images), which is why the single responsive `h-7 sm:h-8` on the landing header works.
- **Brand kit + spec:** `build-brand-kit.mjs` reworked to the logo v2 (two-tone dark mark, Größer
  app-icon tile, the lowercase "genauly" wordmark as PNG copied from `public/`, PNG lockups; drops
  the `wordmark-data.mjs` capital-G dependency) and regenerated; `brand-kit/README.md`,
  `BRAND_SPEC.md` §3, and the CLAUDE.md brand section rewritten. The 8-round preview artifact is
  saved at `preview/branding/artifacts/genauly-logo-v2-previews.html`.
- **Gates:** typecheck ✓ · lint 0 errors ✓ · test:unit 219/219 ✓ · build ✓ · bundle 110.5 kB ✓.
  Verified rendered output via `pnpm preview` + headless Chromium (landing light/dark/mobile,
  /hilfe dark) and the regenerated brand-kit contact sheet. PWA caveat: hard-refresh the live site;
  the home-screen icon may need re-adding to show the new size.
