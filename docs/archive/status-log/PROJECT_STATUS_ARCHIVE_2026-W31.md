**Handoff after session 173 (2026-07-27). The app no longer refreshes work away. Merged as PR #740
(`805fff0`), branch `claude/app-refresh-data-loss-01xd0e`.**
Founder bug report: "whenever the user is working on something like writing an email or practicing an
Übung session, the update takes place and the app refreshes", losing the draft or the session. Root
cause was `src/lib/swUpdate.ts`: when a new service worker took control it reloaded unconditionally,
either immediately (within 30s of load) or **at the next resume from the background**, which is
exactly the moment a learner returns to a half-written email. Fixed in two layers:
- **Layer 1, never reload over live work.** New `src/lib/liveWork.ts` is a tiny module-level registry
  (not a store: the reloaders run outside React). A surface holding unsaved in-memory work claims it
  via the `useLiveWork(active, label, flush)` hook; `hasLiveWork()` gates every automatic reload, so
  a queued deploy simply waits and retries on each later resume. The app runs fine on the old bundle
  meanwhile. Claimants today: the Fokus / Kurz / Lang editors (non-empty text) and a running Üben run.
- **Layer 2, make any unavoidable reload recoverable.** Some reloads must still happen (a chunk-load
  self-heal in `lib/recover.ts`, a manual refresh, iOS discarding the tab), so work now persists:
  - `src/features/writing/draftAutosave.ts` (localStorage, one draft PER mode, 7-day TTL) autosaves
    500ms after the last keystroke and on unmount/pagehide, and restores on mount. It is deliberately
    a **separate key and record** from `resumeDraft.ts`: that one is the sign-in hand-off with the
    `resume: true` flag AppShell redirects on, and an autosave must never trigger that redirect.
  - `src/features/session/sessionResume.ts` (**sessionStorage**, keyed by a signature of the launch
    params, 3h TTL) snapshots plan + index + tallies + loot. sessionStorage on purpose: it survives a
    reload of the tab but dies with it, so a learner who opens Üben tomorrow gets a fresh session,
    never a silent resume. The snapshot always points at the next **unanswered** block, since an
    answered one is already graded into FSRS/XP and replaying it would double-count. Cleared on
    finish, on "Beenden", and on "Neue Runde" (with an `abandoned` ref so the unmount flush cannot
    write it back).
- `installLiveWorkFlush()` in `main.tsx` flushes every claim on pagehide / beforeunload / hidden, so
  even a reload nobody asked for lands on the restore path.
- `tests/liveWork.test.ts` (18 cases) pins the registry, per-mode draft isolation, staleness, corrupt
  storage, and that a snapshot never resumes into a differently-scoped session.
- **Not verifiable from the sandbox:** service-worker update behavior needs the live site. What the
  founder should see after the deploy: backgrounding the app mid-draft and returning no longer wipes
  the editor, and a refresh restores both the text and its Aufgabe. Hard-refresh once first, since a
  stale service worker can still serve the pre-fix build for one launch.
- **Worth knowing for the next reload-ish change:** the rule is now a CLAUDE.md hard invariant, so any
  new surface that holds in-memory work must both claim `useLiveWork` AND persist itself. Persisting
  alone is not enough (the reload still throws away the on-screen state around the draft), and
  claiming alone is not enough (a chunk-load self-heal ignores no-one's convenience).
- **Deliberately NOT done:** no "a new version is available, reload?" toast. The founder's report was
  about interruption, and a banner is a second interruption; the queued-update-on-next-safe-resume
  path ships the same deploy without asking anything of the learner. Revisit only if a deploy ever
  needs to be forced out mid-session (e.g. a broken backend contract).
